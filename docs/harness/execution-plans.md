# Execution Plans

## Active Plan

### PWA Local-First MVP

Status: in progress.

Completed:

- Converted core Products, Periods, and Installations pages from Supabase-driven demo behavior to IndexedDB local storage.
- Added PWA manifest, icon, service worker, and registration component.
- Removed remote Google Fonts dependency for offline-friendly builds.
- Added Settings & Data Safety page with `.cbam` backup export/import and local data clearing.
- Created this harness documentation set for agent-first development.
- Added Production Processes local data model and UI, mapped to EU template `D_Processes`.
- Added Purchased Precursors local data model and UI, mapped to EU template `E_PurchPrec`.

Next:

- Extend calculation engine toward process and precursor attribution.
- Add EU template export, starting with product summary.

## Decision Log

- 2026-05-29: PWA is the primary free distribution channel to avoid installer trust warnings and reduce SaaS data exposure concerns.
- 2026-05-29: Docker/on-prem deployment is deferred as a future paid/supportable edition for multi-user company environments.
- 2026-05-29: `revfactory/harness` is not installed because it is Claude Code native; this repository uses a Codex-native lightweight harness through versioned docs.
